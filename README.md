This repository contains PayPal's PHP SDK and samples for REST API.


## Prerequisites

   * PHP 5.3 or above
   * curl, json & openssl extensions must be enabled
   * composer for fetching dependencies (See http://getcomposer.org)



## Running the sample

   * `Composer` is the recommended way to get the SDK. Ensure that you have composer installed on your machine, navigate to the samples folder and run 'composer update --no-dev' to fetch the SDK.
   * In case you cannot install composer on your machine, you can also fetch the SDK bundle from https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/raw/gh-pages/rest-api-sdk/php/rest-api-sdk-php-0.7.1.zip and unzip the bundle in to the samples folder.
   * Optionally, update the bootstrap.php file with your own client Id and client secret.
   * Run any of the samples in the 'samples' folder to see what the APIs can do.
    
    
## Usage

To write an app that uses the SDK 

   * Copy the composer.json file from the sample folder over to your project and run 'composer update --no-dev' to fetch all dependencies.
   * Copy the sample configuration file sdk_config.ini to a location of your choice and let the SDK know your config path using the following define directive.

```php
    define('PP_CONFIG_PATH', /path/to/your/sdk_config.ini);
```
    
   * Obtain your clientId and client secret from the developer portal. You will use them to create a `OAuthTokenCredential` object.
   * Now you are all set to make your first API call. Create a resource object as per your need and call the relevant operation or invoke one of the static methods on your resource class.
    
```php

    $apiContext = new ApiContext(new OAuthTokenCredential('<clientId>', '<clientSecret>'));
		
    $payment = new Payment();

    $payment->setIntent("Sale");

    ...

    $payment->create($apiContext);

      *OR*

    $payment = Payment::get('payment_id', $apiContext);
```

## SDK Configuration

The samples in this repo pick the SDK configuration from the sdk_config.ini file. If you do not want to use an ini file or want to pick your configuration dynamically, you can use the `$apiContext->setConfig()` method to pass in the configuration as a hashmap. See the `sample/bootstrap.php` file for an example.
