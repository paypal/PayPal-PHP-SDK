Rest API Samples
===================


This sample project is a simple web app that you can explore to understand what the payment APIs can do for you. To try out the sample, run `composer update --no-dev` from the samples folder and you are all set. In case you cannot install composer on your machine, you can fetch the SDK download bundle from https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/raw/gh-pages/rest-api-sdk/php/rest-api-sdk-php-0.7.1.zip and unzip the contents to the samples folder.


The sample comes pre-configured with a test account but in case you need to try them against your account, you must
   
   * Obtain your client id and client secret from the developer portal
   * Update the sdk_config.ini file with your new client id and secret.
   
   
If you are looking for a full fledged application that uses the new RESTful APIs, check out the Pizza store sample app at https://github.com/paypal/rest-api-sample-app-php
