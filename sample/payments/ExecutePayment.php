// #Execute Payment Sample
// This is the second step required to complete
// PayPal checkout. Once user completes the payment, paypal
// redirects the browser to "redirectUrl" provided in the request.
// This sample will show you how to execute the payment
// that has been approved by
// the buyer by logging into paypal site.
// You can optionally update transaction
// information by passing in one or more transactions.
// API used: POST '/v1/payments/payment/<payment-id>/execute'.

    // payment id was previously stored in session in
    // CreatePaymentUsingPayPal.php

    // PaymentExecution object includes information necessary
    // to execute a PayPal account payment.
    // The payer_id is added to the request query parameters
    // when the user is redirected from paypal back to your site
    $execution = new PaymentExecution();

    // Execute the payment
